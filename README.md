# Developing-machine-learning-algorithms

These are some implementations of machine learning algorithms.

1. Naive Bayes plus implementation of Underflow, Additive smoothing, and the possibility of using numerical attributes

2. Linear Regression (Gradient Descent Method) plus implementation of Ridge and Stochastic Gradient

3. K-means plus the implementation of X-means, K-means++, and Silhouette Coefficient

4. AdaBoost plus implementation of using differenet weak algorithms
